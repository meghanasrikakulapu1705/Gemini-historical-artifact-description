# Gemini Historical Artifact Description

## 1. Project Overview

The **Gemini Historical Artifact Description** project is a cloud-based web application developed using **Python and Flask**. The main goal of this project is to automatically generate detailed and meaningful descriptions of historical artifacts using **Google Gemini Generative AI**. The application also enhances user engagement by displaying an interesting historical fact while generating the description.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Cloud Application Development**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Generative AI** in a real-world scenario.

## 2. What I Did in This Project (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Project Folder Creation

I created a project folder named:

```
Cloud_AI_Project
```

Inside this folder, I organized the files as follows:

```
Cloud_AI_Project
 ├── Cloud_AI_Project.py   (Main Python file)
 ├── templates
 │     └── index.html     (HTML frontend)
 └── static               (For future CSS/JS files)
```

This structure follows standard Flask project conventions.

---

### Step 2: Setting Up Flask Backend

I used **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework, to build the backend of the application.

Responsibilities of the backend:

* Handle HTTP requests from the user
* Accept user input (artifact name and word count)
* Communicate with Gemini Generative AI
* Send generated output to the frontend

---

### Step 3: Creating the User Interface (Frontend)

I created an HTML file (`index.html`) inside the `templates` folder. This file provides:

* A form to enter the artifact name
* A field to specify word count
* A button to generate the description
* Sections to display the AI-generated description and historical fact

The frontend is simple and user-friendly so that anyone can use it without technical knowledge.

---

### Step 4: Integrating Gemini Generative AI

To generate real AI-based descriptions, I integrated **Google Gemini Generative AI** using its official Python SDK.

Steps followed:

1. Generated an API key using Google AI Studio
2. Installed the required library (`google-generativeai`)
3. Configured the API key in the Python code
4. Sent user input as a prompt to Gemini AI
5. Received and displayed the generated response

This step demonstrates the use of **NLP and prompt-based text generation**.

---

### Step 5: Adding Historical Fact Feature

To make the application more engaging, I added a feature that displays a random historical fact whenever a description is generated. This was implemented using a predefined list of facts and Python’s random selection.

---

### Step 6: Running the Application

The application runs on a local development server:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

This simulates a cloud environment and demonstrates client–server communication.

## 4. Complete Backend Code (Cloud_AI_Project.py)

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import google.generativeai as genai
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure Gemini API
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")

facts = [
    "Ancient Egyptians believed gold was the flesh of the gods.",
    "Leonardo da Vinci wrote many of his notes in mirror writing.",
    "The Bayeux Tapestry is nearly 70 meters long."
]

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def home():
    description = ""
    fact = ""

    if request.method == "POST":
        artifact = request.form["artifact"]
        words = request.form["words"]

        prompt = f"Write a {words}-word detailed historical description of {artifact}."
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        description = response.text

        fact = random.choice(facts)

    return render_template("index.html", description=description, fact=fact)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## 5. Complete Frontend Code (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Gemini Historical Artifact Description</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Gemini Historical Artifact Description</h2>

    <form method="post">
        <label>Artifact Name / Period:</label><br>
        <input type="text" name="artifact" required><br><br>

        <label>Word Count:</label><br>
        <input type="number" name="words" required><br><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Generate Description">
    </form>

    {% if fact %}
        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>{{ fact }}</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if description %}
        <h3>Generated Description</h3>
        <p>{{ description }}</p>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>
```

## 6. How This Project Uses NLP

* User input is converted into a structured prompt
* The prompt is processed by Gemini AI
* NLP techniques are used internally by the AI to understand context and generate meaningful text

## 7. Applications of the Project

* Museums and exhibitions
* Educational institutions
* Historical research
* Content creation for blogs and articles

## 8. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the integration of cloud application development with generative AI and NLP. By using Flask and Google Gemini AI, the system provides an automated, efficient, and interactive way to generate historical artifact descriptions. The project is scalable, user-friendly, and suitable for real-world applications.
